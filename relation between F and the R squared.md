1. there is an important relationship between the coefficient of determination $R^2$ and the F ratio used in ANOVA. 
2. This relationship is ![[Pasted image 20250213171440.png]]
3. the above equation depicts the relationship between the F and the R squared. where the R squared is zero the F is zero ipso facto. 
4. the larger the value of R square is larger the value of F would be. In the limit when R squared is 1, F will be infinite. 
5. the F test is also a measure of the overall significance of the R squared as well as the significance of the estimated regression line. 
6. therefore testing the null hypothesis is the same as testing the null hypothesis that R squared is zero. 
7. a large R squared value would likely imply a large F value which would mean a great evidence against the null hypothesis.

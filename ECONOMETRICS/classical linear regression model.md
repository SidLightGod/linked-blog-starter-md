## the assumptions under this model: 
1. the regression model is linear in parameter 
2. the explanatory variable 'X' is uncorrelated with the disturbance term u 
3. given the value of Xij, the expected, or mean, value of the disturbance term is zero. 
4. the variance of each Uij is constant, or homoscedastic (homo means equal and scedastic means variance.)
5. there is no correlation between the error terms 
6. there is no specification bias or specification error.

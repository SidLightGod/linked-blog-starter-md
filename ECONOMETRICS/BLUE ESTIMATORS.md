##### what are the properties of the blue estimators 
1. b1 and b2 are linear estimators that is they are linear functions of the random variable Y. 
2. they are unbiased implying that the E(b1) = B1 and E(b2) = B2 therefore on average the b1 and b2 will coincide with the true values of the B1 and B2. 
3. the OLS estimator of the error variance is unbiased. 
4. the b1 and b2 are efficient estimators which means that the var of b1 and b2 are less than the variance of any other unbiased linear estimator of B1 and B2.

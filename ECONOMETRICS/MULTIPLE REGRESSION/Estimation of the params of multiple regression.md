# Ordinary Least Squares Estimators 
1. to find OLS estimators, let us first write the sample regression function SRF corresponding to the PRF Eq as follows : 
2. $$ Y_t = b_1 + b_2X_{2t} + b_3X_{3t} + e_t $$
3. $$ \hat{Y} = b_1 + b_2X_{2t} + b_3X_{3t} $$
4. the e is the residual term or simply the residual - the sample counterpart of u - and where the b's are the estimators of population coefficient, the B's. More specifically, 
5. $b_1$ = the estimator of B1, b2 = the estimator of B2, b3 = estimator B3. 
6. this is the sample counter part of the equation and is the estimated population regression line (PRL). 
7. we can obtain the RSS which is  $\sum{e^2_t}$ and is equal to $$ \sum{(Y_t - b_1 - b_2X_{2t} - b_3X_{3t})^2 } $$

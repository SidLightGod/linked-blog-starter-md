1. $B_2$ and $B_3$ are known as the partial regression or partial slope coefficient. 
2. the meaning of the partial regression coefficient is that $B_2$ measures the change in the mean value of Y per unit change in $X_2$, holding the value of $X_3$ constant. 


> in short, then a partial regression coefficient measures the partial effect of one explanatory variable on the mean value of the dependent variable when the values of other explanatory variables included in the model are held constant.

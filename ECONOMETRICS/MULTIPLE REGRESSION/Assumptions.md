1. the regression model is linear in parameter 
2. X2 and X3 are uncorrelated with the disturbance term u
3. the error term has a zero mean value 
4. homoscedasticity, that is the variance of u is constant 
5. No autocorrelation exists between the error terms 
6. No exact collinearity exists between $X_2$ and $X_3$ that is , there is no exact linear relationship between the two explanatory variables. 
7. for hypothesis testing, the error term u follows the normal distribution with mean zero and homoscedastic variance

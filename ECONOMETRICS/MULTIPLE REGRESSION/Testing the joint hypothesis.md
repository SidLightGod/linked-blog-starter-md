1. the null hypothesis here is that B2 and B3 are jointly or simultaneously equal to zero. $$ H_0 : B_2 = B_3 = 0 $$
2. this hypothesis states that two explanatory variable together have no influence on Y. 
3. This is the same as saying that $$ H_0 : R^2 = 0 $$
4. this implies that the two explanatory variable explains zero percent of variation in the dependent variable, therefore the two sets of hypotheses are equivalent, one implies the other. 
5. a test of either hypothesis is called a test of overall significance of the estimated multiple regression. 
6. to test this we use the technique known as ANOVA or analysis of variance. The analysis of the components of the TSS is known as the analysis of variance. (ANOVA)

> the degree of freedom of TSS is always n - 1 and for RSS is n - k and ESS is 2 in case of three variable model. 

$$ F = \frac{ESS}{df}\frac{df}{RSS} $$
if the computed F value exceeds the critical F value we reject the null hypothesis 
or 
if the p value is less than or equal to the level of significance $\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis and if the p value is greater we fail to reject the null hypothesis

1. an important property of the R squared is that the higher the number of explanatory variable the higher the R squared is. 
2. However it is to be noted that the R squared does not take into the account the degrees of freedom. 
3. thus what we need is a goodness of fit that is adjusted for the number of explanatory variables in the model. Such a measure is devised and is known as the adjusted R squared. 
4. the formula for R squared is $$ \bar{R^2} = 1 - (1 - R^2)\frac{(n - 1)}{(n - k)} $$

###### some features of adjusted R squared are 
1. if K is greater than 1, the adjusted R squared is less than or equal to the R squared, implying as the number of explanatory variables increase in the model the adjusted R squared become increasingly smaller than the unadjusted R squared. there seems to be some "penalty" for increasing the number of explanatory variables. 
2. although the unadjusted R squared is always positive, the adjusted R squared can occasionally turn out to be negative.

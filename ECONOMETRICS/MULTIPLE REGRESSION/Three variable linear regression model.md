1. generalizing the two variable population regression function PRF, we can write the three variable PRF in its non stochastic form as 
2. $$ E(Y_T) = B_1 + B_2X_{2t} + B_3X_{3t} $$
3. and in the stochastic form as $$ Y_t = B_1 + B_2X_{2t} +B_3X_{3t} + u_t $$$$ = E(Y_t) + u_t$$ where Y = the dependent variable $X_2$ and $X_3$ are the explanatory variables, u = the stochastic disturbance term and t = the *t*th observation 
4. in case the data is cross sectional, the subscript i will denote the i-th observation. 
5. $B_1$ is the intercept term, it represents the average value of Y when the $X_2$ and $X_3$ are set equal to zero. The coefficient B2 and B3 are called the partial regression coefficient. 
6. the stochastic version can be explained as the sum of two components one being the systematic or deterministic component and the other being the non systematic or random, component determined by factors other than $X_2$ and $X_3$

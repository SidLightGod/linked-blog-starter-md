1. the OLS estimators are the best linear unbiased estimators (BLUE). This property continues to hold for multiple regression. 
2. Thus, each regression coefficient estimated by the OLS is linear and unbiased - on average it coincides with the true value. 
3. among all such linear unbiased estimators, the OLS estimators have the least variance so that the true parameter can be estimated more accurately than by the competing linear unbiased estimators. In short, the OLS estimators are efficient.

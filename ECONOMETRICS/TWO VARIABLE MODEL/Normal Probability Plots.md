1. another comparatively simple graphical device used to study the PDF of a random variable is the normal probability plots NPP 
2. this makes use of the normal probability paper, a specifically ruled graph paper. 
3. on the horizontal axis we plot the variable of interest (say the OLS residuals) and on the vertical axis, we show the expected values of the variable if its distribution were normal 
4. therefore if the variable is in fact from the normal population, the NPP will approximate a straight line. 
5. MINITAB has the capability of plotting the NPP of any random variable. 
6. MINITAB also produces the Anderson Darling normality test, knowns as the $A^2$
7. the underlying null hypothesis is that the variable is normally distributed. This hypothesis can be sustained if the computed $A^2$ is not statistically significant.

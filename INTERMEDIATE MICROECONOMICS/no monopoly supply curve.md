1. with a fixed market demand curve, the supply curve for the monopoly will only be a single point, namely that price and output combination for which the MC = MR. 
2. if the demand curve should shift the marginal revenue curve will also shit and a new profit maximizing output would be chosen. 
3. connecting these different equilibrium points would have little meaning, it would give a strange shape.

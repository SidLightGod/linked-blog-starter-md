1. a primary technical barrier to entry is that the production of good exhibits a decreasing marginal cost (and average cost) over a wide range of output levels. 
	- the technology of the production is such that relatively large scale firms are low cost producers. 
	- in this situation the firm might find it profitable to drive others out of the industry by cutting prices. 
	- similarly, once a monopoly is established, entry will be difficult because any new firm must produce at relatively low levels of outputs and therefore at a larger average cost. 
	- ==it is important to stress that the range of declining cost needs to be "large" relative to the market in question

2. another technical basis of monopoly is the special knowledge of low cost productive technique 
	- when the matters of technology are involved, this may be extremely difficult, unless the technology is protected by patent. 
3. ownership of unique resources - such as mineral deposits or land locations or possession of unique management talents - may also be a lasting basis for maintaining a monopoly

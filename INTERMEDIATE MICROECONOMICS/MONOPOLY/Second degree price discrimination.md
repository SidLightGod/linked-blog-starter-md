### TWO PART TARIFFS - THE IDEA
1. one form of price schedule that has been extensively studied is a two part tariff, under which the demanders must pay a fixed fee for the right to consume a good and a uniform price for each unit consumed. 
2. the prototype case, first studied by Walter Oi is an amusement park that sets a basic entree fee coupled with a marginal price for each amusement used. 
3. mathematically this scheme can be represented by the tariff any demander must pay to purchase q units of a good. 
4. $T(q) = a + pq$
5. where the a is the fixed fee and p is the marginal price to be paid. The monopolist's goal is then to choose a and p to maximize profits, given the demand for this product. Because the average price paid by any demander is given by 
6. $$\bar{p} = \frac{T}{q} = \frac{a}{q} + p$$
7. this tariff is feasible only when those who pay low average prices (those for whom the q is large) can not resell the good to whose who pay high average prices (those for whom the q is small)







## THE OI MODEL
1. One approach suggested by Oi for setting the parameters for the linear tariff would be for the firm to set the marginal price equal to MC. 
2. and then set a so as to extract the maximum consumer surplus from a given set of buyers. 
3. one might imagine the buyers to be arrayed according to their willingness to pay 
4. the choice of p = MC would then maximize consumer surplus for this group and a could be set equal to the surplus enjoyed by the least eager buyer. He or she would then be indifferent about buying the good but all the other buyers would experience net gains from the purchase. 

# THE OPTIMAL TARIFF MODEL
1. considering the effects of a small increase in the price of the commodity over the marginal cost. 
2. this would not effect the net change in the profit earned from the least willing buyer. 
3. the quantity demanded would drop slightly at the margin where p = MC and some of what had previously been consumer surplus would be converted into variable profits because now p > MC for all the other demanders the profit would be increased by the price rise.

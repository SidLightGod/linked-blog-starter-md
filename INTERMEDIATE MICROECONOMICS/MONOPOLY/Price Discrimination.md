##### meaning of price discrimination 
=> a monopoly engages in the price discrimination if it is able to sell otherwise identical units of output at different prices. 
1. In absence of transaction or information cost, the "law of one price" implies that a homogenous good must sell everywhere for the same price. 
2. consequently the price discrimination schemes are doomed to failure because the demanders of the goods who can buy from the monopoly at lower prices will be more attractive sources of the good. 
3. the profit seeking middlemen will destroy any kind of discriminatory pricing scheme. However when the resale is costly or can be prevented entirely, discriminatory pricing scheme becomes possible.

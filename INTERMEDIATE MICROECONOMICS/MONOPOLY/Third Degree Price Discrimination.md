1. the first degree price discrimination puts a considerable amount of burden on the monopoly- it must know the demand function for each potential buyer. 
2. a less stringent requirement would be to assume that the firm can separate its buyers into relatively few identifiable markets and pursue a separate market policy in each market. 
3. the knowledge of price elasticities of demand in each market is enough to pursue a separate monopoly pricing policy in each market. 
4. the monopoly then sets a price in each market based on the inverse elasticity rule, the result is a pricing policy in which : 
5. $$ P_i (1 + \frac{1}{e_i}) = P_j(1 + \frac{1}{e_j}) $$
6. here the Pi and Pj are the prices charged in the market i and j, which have price elasticities of demand given by ei and ej. 
7. the immediate consequence of this pricing structure is that the prices will be higher in the markets where the elasticity of demand is lower or we can say that where the demand is less elastic.

9. in the market 1 the elasticity of the demand is lesser, therefore the gap between the marginal revenue and the price is actually smaller compared to the market 2 where the elasticity of demand is actually higher. 
10. so long as the arbitrage between the two markets can be prevented this price difference can persist.

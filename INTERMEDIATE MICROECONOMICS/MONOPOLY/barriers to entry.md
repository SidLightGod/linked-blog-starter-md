[[meaning of monopoly]]

- the reason a monopoly exists is that the other firms find it unprofitable or impossible to enter the market. 
- the barriers of entry are therefore the source of all monopoly power. 
- if other firms could in fact enter the market then the firm would, by definition, no longer be a monopoly. 
- there are generally two types of barriers of entry : [[technical barriers to entry]] and [[legal barriers]]

#### Marginal cost pricing and natural monopoly dilemma 
1. many economists believe it is important for the prices charged by the regulated monopolies to reflect the marginal cost of production accurately. 
2. in this way the deadweight loss may be minimized. the principal problem of the enforced monopoly policy is that it would require the monopolies to operate at a loss. 
3. Natural monopolies by definition exhibit a decreasing average cost of production over a broad range of output levels.

5. in absence of any price regulation the monopoly will operate at the $Q_A$ and receive a price $P_A$ for its product 
6. the profits in this case would be given by the rectangle $P_A$ABC. 
7. A regulatory agent might set the price for the monopoly at $P_R$ for the monopoly. 
8. At this price, $Q_R$ is demanded and the marginal cost of producing this level of output is also $P_R$. Consequently the marginal cost pricing has been achieved. 
9. however due to the negative slope of the average cost curve, the price falls below the average cost. With this regulated price the monopoly must operate at a loss of GFE$P_R$ 
10. because no firm can operate at a loss indefinitely, this posses a dilemma for the regulatory agency, either it must abandon its goal of marginal cost pricing, or the government must subsidize the monopoly forever.

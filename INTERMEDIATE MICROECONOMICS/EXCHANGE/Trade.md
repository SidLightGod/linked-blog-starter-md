1. we start at the original endowment of the good denoted by W. 
2. consider the indifference curves of A and B that pass through these points of allocation. 
3. the region where A is better off than at her endowment consists of all the indifference curves through W. 
4. ![[Pasted image 20250208143022.png]]
5. the region where B is better off than at her endowment consists of all allocations that are above - from his point of view - his indifference curve through W. 
6. the region where both A and B are better off is in the intersection of both the regions, which is evident from the lens shaped diagram above 
7. in the course of their negotiations the two people will find some mutually beneficial point that will move them to some point inside the lens shaped areas such as point M 
8. the particular movement to the point M as depicted in the diagram involves A giving up $|x^1_A - w^1_A|$ units of good 1 and acquiring in exchange |$x^1_B - w^1_B$| units of good 2. 
9. any allocation inside the lens shaped region would be possible - for every allocation of good inside this region is an allocation that makes each consumer better off than he or she was at the original endowment 
10. now we can draw two different indifferent curves through point M to construct a new lens shaped "region of mutual advantage" and imagine the traders moving to some point N in this region and so it goes... the trade will continue until there are no more trades that are preferred by both the parties.

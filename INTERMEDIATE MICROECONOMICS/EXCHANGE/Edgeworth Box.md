> there is a convenient graphical tool known as the Edgeworth Box which can be used to analyze the exchange of two goods between two people. 


> the Edgeworth Box helps us to depict the endowment and preferences of two individuals in one convenient diagram, which can be used to depict various outcomes of the trading process. 

1. let us call the two people involved in the process A and B and the two goods 1 and 2. 
2. We will determine A's consumption bundle by $X_A = (x^1_A, x^2_A)$ , the $x^1_A$ represents A's consumption of good 1 and the "2" term represents A's consumption of good 2. 
3. a pair of consumption bundle $X_A$ and $X_B$ is called an allocation. **An allocation is a feasible allocation if the total amount of each good consumer is equal to the total amount available.** 
4. $$ x^1_A + x^1_B = w^1_A + w^1_B$$
5. a particular feasible allocation which is of interest is the initial endowment allocation ($w^1_A, w^2_A$) and ($w^1_B, w^2_B$). This is the allocation that the consumer starts with 
6. it consists of the amount of good that the consumer brings to the market. They will exchange some of these goods with each other in the course of trade to end up with a **final allocation.**

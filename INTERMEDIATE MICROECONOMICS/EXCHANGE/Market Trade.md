lets try to describe a trading process that mimics the outcome of a competitive market 

### the case of disequilibrium 

1. suppose that we have a third party who is willing to act as an auctioneer for the two agents A and B. 
2. each agent then sees how much his or her endowment is worth at the prices p1 and p2 and decides how much of each good he or she would want at those prices. 
3. ![[Pasted image 20250208222746.png]]
4. the above figure depicts the two demanded bundles of the two agents. 
5. the gross demand of agent A for good 1 is the total amount of good 1 that he or she wants at the going price 
6. the net demand for agent A for good 1 is just the difference between the total demand and his initial endowment. 
7. in the context of equilibrium analysis the net demand is sometimes also called the excess demand and we depict the excess demand of good 1 by $e^1_A$ 
8. therefore we have a relationship between these variables : $$ e^1_A = x^1_A - w^1_A$$
9. we will use the term demand to denote gross demand and specifically use net demand to denote net demand or excess demand. 
10. for arbitrary prices p1 and p2 there is no guarantee that supply will equal demand- in either sense of demand 
11. in terms of net demand this would imply that the amount A wants to buy or sell would not necessarily equal the amount that B wants to buy or sell. 
12. in terms of gross demand this simply means that the total amount of good that the two agents want to hold of the goods is not equal to the amount that is available. 
13. in the above diagram, the two agents will not be able to complete their desired transaction and this is the case of disequilibrium 
14. in such a situation it is natural to think that the auctioneer will simply change the price of the goods. If there is excess demand for one good the auctioneer will increase the price for that good and if there is an excess supply of one good the auctioneer will reduce the price of that good. 
15. suppose that this adjustment continues until the demand for each good equals the supply 


### the case of equilibrium 

1. ![[Pasted image 20250208225036.png]]
2. in the above diagram the amount that A wants to buy of good 1 just equals the amount that B wants to sell of the good 1, and similarly for good 2. 
3. in other words the total amount that each person want to buy of each good at the current prices is equal to the total amount available. in such a case we say that the market is in equilibrium, more precisely this is called a market equilibrium or competitive equilibrium or a Walrasian equilibrium.

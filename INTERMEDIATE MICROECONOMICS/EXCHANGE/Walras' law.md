###### THE MEANING OF THIS LAW 
Walras' law states that the sum of excess demands across all markets must equal zero if all markets are considered together. 

> this implies that the existence of excess supply in one market must be matched by excess demand in another market so that both factors are balanced out. 

###### the intuition 
> if n-1 markets are in equilibrium then the nth market must also be in equilibrium. This holds true because people only have a limited budget so they can't buy more than what they have income for. 

> this also implies that the value of aggregate excess demand is identically zero. this 
> is basically the macroeconomic way of writing the budget constraint.

1. the region where A is made better off is disjoint from the region where the B is made better off. 
2. this implies that any movement made by one of the parties that makes one of them necessarily better off makes the other party worse off. 
3. so there is no mutually improving trade at such an allocation, an allocation such as this is known as a Pareto efficient allocation. 
4. at a Pareto efficient point, each person is at their highest indifference curve, given the indifference curve of the other person. the lines connecting these points is known as the **contract curve**. 

###### Describe a Pareto efficient allocation? 
1. there is no way of making all the people better off
2. there is no way of making some individual better off without making someone else worse off 
3. all of the gains from trade has been exhausted 
4. there is no mutually advantageous trade to be made 



> the set of all the Pareto efficient points in the Edgeworth box is known as the Pareto set or the contract curve.

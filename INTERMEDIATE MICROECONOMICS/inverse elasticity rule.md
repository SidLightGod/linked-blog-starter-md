1. the gap between the price of a firm's output and the marginal cost is inversely related to the price elasticity of demand curve faced by the firm. 
$$
1. P - MC /P = -1/Eq,p
$$

### two observations this provides for the monopoly pricing 

1. first a monopoly will choose to operate only in the regions in which the market demand curve is elastic. implying the Eq,p < -1. 
2. if the demand were inelastic the marginal revenue would be negative which can not be equated to the marginal cost which is positive. 
3. the second implication is that the firm's markup over marginal cost depends inversely on the elasticity of market demand 
4. the market price moves proportionally to the marginal cost. increase in the marginal cost would prompt the monopoly to increase its price proportionally.

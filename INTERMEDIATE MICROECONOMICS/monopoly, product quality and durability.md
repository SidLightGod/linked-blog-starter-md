- suppose the willingness of the consumer to pay for a quality (X) is given by the inverse demand function P(Q,X), where 
	- $\frac{dP}{dQ}<0$ and $\frac{dP}{dX} > 0$
	- if the cost of the producing Q and X is given by the cost function then the monopoly will choose the level of X and Q that maximizes the profit
	- this implies we will have to deal with a lagrangian that maximizes the profit given the cost constraint. 

## the durability of the durable goods. 
1. these goods are automobiles, houses, refrigerators, etc. these goods provide service to the owners for a period rather than being used up soon after purchase 
2. the element of time introduces some interesting problems and paradoxes. the notion that the monopoly would under produce durability was shown to be incorrect by the Australian economist Peter Swan in early 1970s. 
3. Swan's insight was to view the demand for durable goods as the demand for a flow of services over several periods. 
4. He argued that both the Monopoly and a competitive market would choose an output level that minimizes the cost of producing this flow to the consumers 
5. the monopoly would of course choose an output level that minimizes this flow of services so as to maximize the profits - but assuming constant returns to scale in production 
6. there is no reason that durability per se will be affected by the market structure. This result is sometimes referred to as the Swan's Independence assumption. Output decisions can be treated independently from decisions about the product durability 

##### when does the Swan's independence assumption not hold true 
1. the independence assumption continues to hold true even in the case of smooth deterioration of the good - if the good is replaced - this requires that new goods are perfect substitutes and are infinitely divisible 
2. On the other hand most goods can not be simply replaced like that, for example refrigerator can not be replaced by half of a new one. 
3. once such a complex forms of deterioration are considered the Swan's assumption may not hold true as we do not fall back upon the notion of providing a flow of services at minimal costs over time. 
4. in these more complex cases however it is not always the case that the monopoly will produce less durable goods, it depends more on the nature of demand for durability

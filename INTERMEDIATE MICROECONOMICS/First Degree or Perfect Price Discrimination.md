1. this figure assumes that the consumers are arranged in the descending order of their willingness to pay 
2. the first buyer is willing to pay up to P5 price level for Q1 units of the good. So the monopolist receive P5Q1 amount of revenue 
3. the second buyer is willing to pay P 4 level of price for Q2 - Q1 units of the output, so the amount of revenue the monopolist generates from this is P4(Q2 - Q1). 
4. it is to be noticed that this strategy can not success unless the buyer is unable to resell the output he or she buys for P4 price to the buyer who bought it at P 5 level of price.

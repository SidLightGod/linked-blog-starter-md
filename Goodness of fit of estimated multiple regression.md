1. the R^2 measures the goodness of the fit of the fitted sample regression line. 
2. it gives the proportion or the percentage of the total change in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable. 
3. the quantity that gives the total variation in the dependent variable caused by all the independent variables is given by the R^2 also known as the multiple coefficient of determination. 
4. $R^2$ is equal to $\frac{ESS}{TSS}$ 
5. $$ ESS = b_2\sum{y_tx_{2t} } + b_3\sum{y_tx_{3t} } $$
6. $$ RSS = \sum{y^2_t} - b_2\sum{y_tx_{2t}} - b_3\sum{y_tx_{3t}}$$
7. the R is known as the coefficient of multiple correlation, which is basically the positive square root of the $R^2$

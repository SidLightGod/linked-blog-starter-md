1. the total profits earned by the monopoly can be read directly from the diagram below ![[Pasted image 20250128110912.png]]
2. this rectangle represents the price minus the average cost times the number of units sold. 
3. these profits will be positive if the market price exceeds the average total cost. If the price is lower than the average cost then the monopoly can operate only on a long term loss and will decline to serve the market. 
4. because (by assumption) no entry is possible into a monopoly market, the monopolist's profit can exist even in the long run as monopoly rents. 
5. these profits can be regarded as the factors that forms the basis of the monopoly such as patents, favorable location, etc. 
6. although a monopolist can earn positive profits in the long run, the size of such profits will depend on the relationship between the monopolist's average cost and the demand function 
7. when the market price is equal to the average total cost, there will be a zero profit monopoly.
